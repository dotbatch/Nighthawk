==========================================

1.0.3 // November 05 2014
-------------------------
- Fixed a bug that occurred when multiple Conductor Widgets existed on a page where custom field
  data was not properly reset in each widget causing undesired output (incorrect or missing
  custom fields); Thanks Lisa Snyder

1.0.2 // October 30 2014
------------------------
- Adjusted Custom Fields Query (Conductor_Widget_Custom_Fields_Query) class to ensure
  other custom field elements with different callback functions wouldn't affect output

1.0.1 // October 24 2014
------------------------
- Added better basic support for custom fields that contain arrays of data
- Adjusted output of custom field callback function to ensure custom field label was always
   output even if custom field value was empty
- Added class_exists() check for updates which fixes a fatal PHP error when
  Conductor_Updates class is not available due to Conductor update occurring

------------------------
- Initial Release
- Added support for updates
- Added CSS for jQuery Autocomplete UI

  missing custom fields when multiple Conductor Widgets existed
