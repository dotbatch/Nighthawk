Introduction
------------
The Conductor Custom Fields Add-On allows custom field data to be placed within Conductor Widget output.

Simply activate the add-on and head over to the Customizer or Appearance > Widgets. Add or edit and existing
Conductor Widget and you'll notice a search box above the output section under Display Settings.

Start typing in the search box and a list of available custom fields will be displayed. Select the correct
custom field value and it will automatically be added to the end of the widget output.

Custom field labels can be adjusted by clicking on the pencil icon. Their position can be altered by
dragging the sort icon up or down.They can also be removed at any time by clicking on the "X" icon.

Don't forget to save your settings when you're finished.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If your custom field data is not output on the front-end, please ensure that your current query (i.e. post type,
category, etc...) supports the custom field (i.e. there is data in the custom field).

At the current state this add-on does not output serialized (array) custom field data.
